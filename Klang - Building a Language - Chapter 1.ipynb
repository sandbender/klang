    "# The K programming language (\"Klang\") - What, and Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The beginning...\n",
    "\n",
    "Klang started as Kragle - a system for building interactions between sites/services/apis. Simple \"scripts\" built from \"standard\" components, which abstracted away the necessary format and structure conversions for the network messages in question (eg: HTTP request/response, et al.) - I wanted a highly re-usable and homogenous way to connect disparate systems, regardless of their pedigree (protocol, OS, etc), and to automate those interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial goal was implemented and incorporated into a working system (Kragle.io, although only ever released as a private beta), and as part of that implementation I derived a few keys pieces of (abstract) core functionality, which the rest was built upon and enabled thereby:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A pluggable system for supporting various kinds of network conversations, eg: http, dns, etc. In addition to that, each system would require different variants/configurations: http, https, https-with-basic, https-with-oauth, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. By itself, this is far from innovative... but the main reason behind this requirement is to provide a *universal* interface to sending and receiving messages from a foreign system. Unlike a programming language, where you can import different libraries which provide interfaces to various protocols, the system itself is upgraded with support for a given protocol, and as long as you're passing the (homogenous) interface an instance of a data structure conforming to the relevant structure schema for the message/procotol/etc type you're trying to send to/receive from, any 'userland' code/configuration/specification needs to know *nothing* about the low-level details of the protocol/etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ^^^ last sent too long, awk\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strict usage of a schema system of some sort for all structures exposed to userland, in order to support things like validation of incoming/outgoing messages, derivation of required fields in the input structure to an output operation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A convention for specifying data structures to be used as 'conversion templates', so that one system's message type can be converted into another dynamically and on the fly, optionally via configurable parameters for each instance of the conversion. (\"Produce a structure of type A, using structure B as the template, with structure C as input.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "*(There were other requirements unique to the system, but which were specific to the system in it's incarnation as a service exposed as an api/black box system, where end-users would have no direct access to the code driving it... as such I'll attempt to strip/limit my references to such requirements, as they are not relevant to the justification of Klang.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The epiphany...\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Kragle had been fully implemented in terms of it's core engine, backend, and api (lacking only a frontend), I was then forced to finally deal with a nagging issue at the time: how to design the UI such that the concepts involved were intuitive enough for the end user (or even average \"power user\"/developer/etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "While struggling with this issue, it dawned on me one day that the reason it's so hard to explain is that what I had essentially produced was a (albeit limited) form of a new programming language, not a specific service that would be sated by a one or two sentence description of 'what it does'. Like a programming language, the intent was that you build things with it, and that the things you built were limited only be the context and imagination of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "So... why not just make it a language instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "### But is a whole new language really justified here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Depends who you ask, and most (myself included, if I was someone else pitching me this idea) would probably have the immediate urge to answer \"no, for fuck's sake, we have enough already!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So I tried to convince myself that no, I'm delusional, you can't have enough good reasons to build a whole new language just to give your Kragle \"pieces\" a home.\n",
    "\n",
    "However try as I might, this nagging realization that I needed to make it a *language* and not a service/api/etc of some kind persisted, try as I might to \"make\" it something else in my head.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maybe it's an operating system instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe... but I don't think so. And I don't think it should be (although as you'll see me ultimately decide, a *virtual machine* is another story... and highly tied to 'interpreted' type language anyways, depending on how pendantic you want to be about the definition of interpreted language).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main job of an operating system is to control and manage userland access to real system resources (disks, memory, network interfaces, processors, etc), to provide a standard (or at least consistent), abstracted interface to those resources, and to execute other programs (the OS is itself just a program).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two of those jobs is already done rather well by the existing options (well enough, anyways, depending on the option ;)), and the second as well, although the second is something we'll try to improve upon, as you'll see).\n",
    "\n",
    "The last, at first glance, seems like it might actually be an attribute of a language, depending on your viewpoint - again, for *interpreted* language, the \"language\" is essentially a virtual machine that is 'executing' your source (program) on demand. We'll leave this point for now, to be addressed later on either explicitly or at least implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ok, so then what are the defining characteristics of a language, and how do the Kragle core features fit in?\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia: \"A programming language is a formal computer language or constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.\" Simple enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine our core Kragle pieces in the context of this definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* (Kragle feature): Homogenous interface for communicating with (*typically* remote) foreign systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * We're saying we want a way of telling the computer to send or receive a given message to/from system X. That's pretty much spot-on - we're defining a \"language\" of sorts (the formal syntax of the mechanism in question) to be used for instructing the computer to communicate with \"some system\" on our behalf. Our particular incarnation of this definition with respect to the homogenous foreign communication is simply very high-level.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* (Kragle feature): Strict usage of data structure schema, for validating/etc \"all the things\". (Note here the recurring theme of homogeneity - we don't want to worry about boilerplate more than once - we just want to be able to send our messages with as little 'in the way' as possible.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * When communicating instructions to a machine, one major requirement is always going to be that the message you use for your communication is well-formed - computers are nothing if not precise and unforgiving. This is the root of the \"issue\" and never-ending discussion around Type Systems: which are best, whether or not they are necessary/desirable, etc. Type systems are intimately tied to the ability to speak to a machine (the goal of a programming language), and our 'structure schema' requirement is just another instance of this: we want a homogenous, high-level way of talking to arbitrary systems... so we also need/want a homogenous, high-level way of validating our messages (data).\n",
    "    \n",
    "* (Kragle feature): Ability to specify conversion templates, as arbitrary data structures, with another arbitrary structure as input to the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Admittedly, rather far removed from the definition of a programming language... but let's break it down a bit. Why do any languages other than machine code (or assembly) exist at all, if the goal is to simply communicate with the machine? The machine already has a 'native' language that we could theoretically use to speak with it. The obvious answer is that writing code in 0's and 1's would be a horrible existence for anyone involved with computers. Speaking a language of our own devising, and then having another program automatically convert this into something the machine will understand, is simply a better approach. Among many other reasons, this **allows us to encapsulate many basic, common operations into easier-to-understand things with names, like \"if\" or \"function\"**, and allows us write out program in such a way that we can refer to these extremely common operations by name, instead of implementing their mechanism every time we wish to use them. Converting data structures in this way (and associated operations) is a very, very common operation in the realm of integrating two heterogeneous protocols/systems/etc, and so having a 'native operation', as well as special syntax for that operation, can be viewed as another example of encapsulating the *most common* operations in your environment as core elements of a the language in which it is programmed, and the set of basic \"operations\" (or \"features\", etc) of a language are the differentiating factor (along with syntax), that separate one language from any other. In our case, we just have a few new/additional basic operations that are requirements for the type of programming we will be doing (integrating arbitrary, heterogenous foreign systems with each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "### So then why not just some form of DSL and accompanying software? Or just a library? (This is not the right spot/heading for this???)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah... now we're getting closer to the point. (Or are we? I've lost my train of thought w.r.t. where I was going for at least 3 or 4 paragraphs now :/ - 2016-09-17)\n",
    "\n",

    "### Ok... so then what are our core requirements of a language (computation in general), from which all else is built?\n",
    "\n",
    "To re-phrase that a little better, what's the difference between a computation/algorithm/etc of some kind, and a simple *operation*? \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is less clear that one might thing. Even a simple operation like addition of two positive integers can itself be considered an algorithm if it's broken down into a step by step process. (\"Take the first number, count UP from it by 1, and iterate X times, where X is the second number...\", etc). It already gets more complicated internally if you allow negative integers in the \"input domain\" (ie: now you have a branching statement: \"If the second number is negative, count DOWN instead...\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the difference is that in order for something to be considered a calculation, it needs to be able to perform *useful* work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine as simple an example as we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Values (\"data\") are limited to either TRUE or FALSE.\n",
    "* We want an algorithm (program) for calculating the inverse of a value\n",
    "\n",
    "One option would be to have a single function, the identity function, which just produces whatever you feed it).\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have an \"input\" value, and I want to calculate the result, I could execute an identity function and pass it the opposite of my input, so that it returns that same value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "F identity(x) x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is far from useful - I'm still doing the 'calculation' myself (determining if the identity function needs to be passed TRUE or FALSE to get the opposite of what my input is) - the computer is essentially just encoding/formatting/outputing my values for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *slightly* more useful program would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "F negation(x) if (x) FALSE else TRUE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Still fairly trivial, but there's an important difference - the \"work\" has been moved out of my head, and into the program - the program is now making the relevant *decision* on my behalf, instead of just recording/echoing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision-making ability is central to the idea of computation - the ability to modify internal behaviour based on varying inputs. The decision making ability is always modelled as a branching statement of some kind - some form of \"if\", and is typically a key component of ALL languages, including one-instruction-set computers and simple lisp-like languages like Scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to process input is also a central one. Without any input, a given algorithm will always produce the same results - ie: it will always do the same thing, with zero variability in the potential outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to process input, we need some way of referring to it, and so in order to perform any useful work an algorithm also needs the ability to bind it's argument(s). (More generally, our language/computation machine/etc needs a way to store a value (the argument), and also a way to refer to it (a variable name, or an index into an infinite-length Turing ticker tape, etc etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Already, we have two core requirements to support *any* kind of *useful* computation whatsoever:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A branching ability (some form of \"if\", so we can make decisions in our algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ability to store a value, and refer to it somehow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ability to signify that the computation is finished, ie: an exit condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there more? Let's talk about complexity for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imaginge the bare minimum requirements we've been able to derive thus far, and describe a few assumptions that are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All operations in our language will always refer to the stored value, if a value is needed\n",
    "* Output is always to the single stored \"place\"\n",
    "* When a program terminates, it's output is the value in the \"place\"\n",

Similarly, the new program for the \"not\" of TRUE depends upon a TRUE being in position 3, a NULL being in position 6, and a FALSE being in position 5.\n",

For a one-memory-cell machine, we had two symbols in our alphabet (TRUE and FALSE), and one input (the program symbol) - this resulted in the ability to perform our computation...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ability to jump to other points in our program can be thought of as the ability to create a tree structure in the code which we can follow, making decisions at each step. But these decisions are still only based on the instruction at that point in the code - other than building huge decision trees, we still have no way of knowing what a previous value was, aside from the fact that we're in a given 'branch' of the tree. But this means that there is at least a linear (if not worse) relation between the number of potential edges in our binary tree - we have to explicitly code the decision tree for every possible execution path. Not ideal.\n",

We will quickly find that it is impossible, since in a situation where we *need* to examine all of the inputs, we will always have a situation where certain input combinations (a TRUE in either the first or second position) will result in a skip ahead past one of the remaining inputs. Even if we reduce our jump distance to be 2 instead of 3, we will still have to skip the second input. And because a jump is always to the right, there's no way to go 'back' to a previous value.\n",

But now that we have more than two input representations, we can use the set of TRUE inputs (positive integers - an infinite set) in the following way: instead of jumping ahead 3 'spaces', the non-zero TRUE value indicates the absolute position in the program to jump to, when program positions (instruction indices) are indexed starting at 1 (because 0 is FALSE, we can't 0-index).\n",

No. The maximum value for any position is limited by it's initial value, meaning that if there's a \"5\" at a given position, that position can only ever fall between 0 and 5, inclusive. So if the max value in a whole program is '15', then regardless of any other values that program would never be able to produce a value greater than 15.\n",

    "* Part (all?) of the problem seems to be that our *data* is tied to our *code* - they are one and the same. If we want to perform a jump to position X, from position Y, the value at position Y needs to first be X, and correspondingly if we want to write the value A into position B, the value at position B first needs to be A + 1, *and* that means we need to perform a jump to A + 1 in order to set the value A into position B. This leads to all sorta of acrobatics in the code, and the aforementioned limits (which are likely a subset of the full limitations inherent in the current approach).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another way to explain this is that because the jump is always to the current value, and we can only modify the current value... if we derive a way of setting a variable at position A to x, then that will always result in a jump to position x. Which also means that *every time we need to write the value 'x' somewhere, we need to then jump to position x, regardless of whether two separate pieces of code writing the value 'x' have anything to do with each other...* there will always be this hard-to-work-around restriction in program flow, and the resulting need to re-compute the values for the rest of the program every time a new piece of code is added or removed, at *best*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's presume an intellectual jump at this point, and realize that *instructions* and *values* need to be treated separately. This means two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The ability to write a result to an arbitrary position instead of to the 'current' position.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        * This is necessary because if we always write to the current position, then our data (the result) shares it's *address* with the instruction that produced it, and overwrites the instruction, hence the two would be coupled.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * The ability to jump to a position other than the position indicated by the value of the result or the position of the result itself.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        * We need to be able to jump arbitrarily to a given position, regardless of the result of the current instruction.\n",
    "        \n",
    "* Also keep in mind that the reason for a jump is because we want to encode the decision-making process into the program, so that it can make decisions based on a value... and we've now said that we want to separate data from the operation, so we need to make the 'jump if' decision based on a \"value\" position, not part of the instruction!\n",
    "        \n",
    "* So let's change our 'machine' again:\n",
    "    * values are now the set of integers (.., -1, 0, 1, ..), or NULL to trigger halt (in first argument position)\n",
    "        * All integers (including negatives) allows us to produce values higher than the highest values in the original source, ie: when coupled with subtraction (subtracting a negative will increase a value)\n",
    "    * We are still subtracting, only we will allow arbitrary subtractions instead of just decrement-by-one, so that we can increase our range of possible stored values in the program to encompass all integers, and also more importantly so that we can *increase* values (subtract negative) instead of always decrease!\n",
    "    * Our decision to jump is still based on a zero/non-zero value, except instead of the zero being part of the operation (subtract 0), we examine the *result* of the operation for 0 to decide if a jump is necessary, that way the values in the subtraction can be whatever we require for the task at hand, and not 'anything but zero'.\n",
    "    * Therefore, we need two values for our instruction: the positions in the program (addresses) holding the values to subtract (we will leave the result as the new value of one of these addresses, for now, and see if that's sufficient).\n",
    "    * We also need a third value to use as part of the instruction: the address to jump to, if the result is non-zero.\n",
    "    * We still just have a single instruction, which is a conditional jump (jump to address X if predicate), it simply spans three values (program addresses) - the single instruction now takes 3 inputs instead of one (we'll say the current instruction pointer and the following two in ascending address order, ie: instruction pointer is position 1, then the inputs for that instruction are at address 1, 2, and 3).\n",
    "        \n",
    "* In summary, our single-instruction machine now looks like this: For a given sequence of values, each of which is an integer or NULL, start at position 1, and halt if NULL. Otherwise, evaluate INSTRUCTION(A, B, C) where A, B, and C are the values at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The INSTRUCTION to execute is \"subtract A from B, store the result in B, and jump to C if the result is non-zero, otherwise proceed to instruction (current position + 3)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* It turns out that this final modification to our bare-bones computing machine **is** Turing-complete... it is almost exactly the same machine/language as SUBLEQ (a one-instruction set computer, or OISC), which uses a \"subtract and branch if result is non-positive (Less-than-or-EQ-to-zero)\". In fact, it's even closer to the known OISC \"SBNZ\" (\"Subtract and Branch if Not equal to Zero\") - the only difference is SBNZ uses four arguments instead of three, for the sake of convenience (this allows many operations to be collapsed into a single instruction, instead of multiple instructions as we'll see below in the first example for our own new machines). Let's see what we can do with our new language/machine, to try and demonstrate this Turing-completeness and the suitability as a *practical, and useful*, bare-bones computing model. We'll use a new syntax, to make the sequence of instructions more obvious, as well as the addresses:\n",

What we need now is to build newer, higher-level constructs with the low-level operations we already have available to us, as well as implement associated requirements/etc... build all the different \"blocks\", like function definitions, subroutines, dictionary structures, whatever, that we can then mix and match (and possibly add to other, new constructs) in order to produce a given language (with a given syntax, based on parse macros/etc... more on that later).\n",

    "  - function definitions and calls:\n",
    "    - need to determine (define) the semantics of variable scope/etc\n",

The reason for the extreme simplicity is that we're aiming for a language that can quickly and easily be used to build other higher-level languages - from experience, most programmers will be able to tell you that the simpler something is (ie: an algorithm/etc), the easier it is to 1) troubleshoot/debug/fix, 2) compose with other things. **this needs more clarification/explanation... still pretty vague/assumption-ridden**\n",

    "Now we have a parser/assembler/compiler that will take a limited form of human-readable source code (bare-bones Klang), and produce an executable binary kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the source code syntax we have created, while Turing-complete, is still rather limited as the basis for a meta-language. For starters, we don't even have a way to define or call functions... instead we have an archaic form of GOTO, which while useful sometimes (especially at rather low levels of abstraction, like assembly), is not what we want to have to work with on a regular basis - instead, we want control structures that we can then represent via syntax, to encapsulate any common control-flow patterns that we might devise or want to otherwise include in our language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have no easy way of creating variable-length values/structures of any kind, since the only paradigm approaching a container of some sort thus far is address-indexing to step through the individual addresses in a block (pointer arithmetic, etc - *See K&R, pp94 et al*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, as we've already discussed briefly, at the high level that we tend to use in our heads as programmers, most all computation can be boiled down to lists of things - a program is often implied to be a list of instructions to carry out, functional programming is not sequential in terms of the program itself, although 'lists' of consecutive (parallel) function definitions abound, and calling functions, whether in the context of a functional language or otherwise, involves passing lists of parameters. Even currying, to allow single-argument functions to be composed into compound functions which effectively operate on multiple arguments to the whole abstraction, exists to emulate lists in languages/situations which otherwise explicitly disallow them. Lists are everywhere in programming in the context of data too - being able to only manipulate single values on their own would quickly become cumbersome, which is why we have arrays, tuples, dictionaries, sets, enumerations... the *list* goes on. Furthermore, when considering programming in the context of mathematics (a framework for defining and executing algorithms against parameters), there are countless well-known mathematical algorithms/procedures/etc which by definition operate over various forms of collecions of values, and not only single values (matrices in 3d graphics, for just one rather obvious example). So... in this context, it's obvious that any higher-level languages will almost always need some way to represent lists of things (\"higher-order\" data structures will always simply be various permutations and/or nestings of the basic list - as a minimalist reduction, any data object will always either be (or be able to be modelled as) a single thing, or a list of things (with the possibility for things in the list to themselves be lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "So this now boils down to a few fresh minimum requirements for a *useful* and *practical* high-level meta-language:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need some way of representing a list or a container\n",
    "* We need some way of defining a function (a 'thing' which can accept input and (optionally?) produce output)\n",
    "* We need some way of calling functions (and capturing/otherwise being able to reference their result(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the first one. To be useful, what does a generic container need?\n",
    "\n",
    "* a way to reference it's member elements\n",
    "* a way to enumerate the container\n",
    "* since elements can be either individual values, or more containers, a way for a container to indicate the type of it's member elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we also need our container representation to be backwards-compatible with our existing data model, namely that an address' value can either be used as a value or the address of another value (value vs. pointer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already have and use 'pointers', let's leverage that and have the data structure for a container be a collection of pointers to it's elements. If we use a linked list, and let the 0 address indicate that there are no more elements in the list, then we get enumeration for free:\n",
